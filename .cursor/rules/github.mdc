# GitHub Rules

- Conventional Commits; PR template must answer schema/back-compat/timeouts/logging
- Ensure CI checks: unit, integration, schema validation
- Should use github actions as optional deployment automation and testing and general CI/CD
- Should run e2e tests with real world data against the enviornment as much as possible
