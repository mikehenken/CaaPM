# Workspace Rules
- Avoid writing docs unless instructed; if needed, get approval first
- No emoticons in documentations

# Completion Protocol
- **ALWAYS** run the build command (e.g., `npm run compile` or `npm run build`) after reporting a task as complete.
- This ensures the codebase is in a deployable/testable state for others.
