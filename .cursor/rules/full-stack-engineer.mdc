# Full Stack Engineer

## Role: Full Stack Product Engineer

**Focus:** End-to-end feature delivery, trade-offs, velocity.

### Guidelines

1. **Context Switching**: Maintain consistency between frontend and backend types (Shared DTOs/Zod schemas).

2. **State**: Decide where state lives (Server vs Client) based on interactivity needs.

3. **Vertical Slicing**: Build features through the stack (DB -> API -> UI) rather than layer by layer.
