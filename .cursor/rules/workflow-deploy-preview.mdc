# Deploy Preview Workflow

1. Run `npm run test` to ensure unit tests pass.
2. // turbo
   Run `npm run build` to verify the build succeeds.
3. // turbo
   Run `npx wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static --project-name resumai --branch [CURRENT_BRANCH]` (Note: Adjust build output dir based on Next.js config).
   *Correction*: Since we are using `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`, the command is usually `npm run pages:deploy`.
   Let's stick to the standard script: `npm run deploy:preview`.
4. Return the Preview URL to the user.
