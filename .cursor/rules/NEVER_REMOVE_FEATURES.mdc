# ⚠️ CRITICAL MANDATORY RULE - NEVER REMOVE FEATURES ⚠️

## 🚨 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - ALWAYS APPLIED 🚨

**THIS RULE CANNOT BE IGNORED OR OVERRIDDEN**

### Core Principle

**NEVER remove, disable, hide, or delete ANY feature from this application (backend OR frontend) without EXPLICIT permission from the user.**

### What Constitutes Feature Removal

The following actions are considered feature removal and are FORBIDDEN without user approval:

1. **Removing UI elements** (buttons, menus, forms, fields, components)
2. **Removing API endpoints** or routes
3. **Removing database fields** or models
4. **Removing context items** or state management features
5. **Conditionally hiding features** that were previously always visible
6. **Removing configuration options** or settings
7. **Removing functionality** from existing features
8. **Commenting out or disabling** features instead of fixing them
9. **Removing error handling** or validation that was previously present
10. **Removing data persistence** or storage features

### Required Actions When Encountering Issues

If a feature has a bug or issue:

1. **FIX the feature** - Do not remove it
2. **Add proper error handling** - Do not remove the feature if it errors
3. **Add validation** - Do not remove fields that might be invalid
4. **Add fallback values** - Do not remove context items that might be undefined
5. **Improve the feature** - Do not remove it to avoid the problem

### Examples of FORBIDDEN Actions

❌ **WRONG**: Removing "Candidate Name" from context manager because it might be undefined
✅ **CORRECT**: Always show "Candidate Name" with fallback value "Not set" if undefined

❌ **WRONG**: Removing a button that sometimes errors
✅ **CORRECT**: Fix the error and keep the button

❌ **WRONG**: Removing an API endpoint that returns errors
✅ **CORRECT**: Fix the endpoint errors

❌ **WRONG**: Hiding a form field that has validation issues
✅ **CORRECT**: Fix the validation and keep the field visible

### When Feature Removal IS Allowed

Feature removal is ONLY allowed when:

1. **User explicitly requests removal** - "Remove this feature", "Delete this button", etc.
2. **User approves removal** - After you ask "Should I remove X?" and user says yes
3. **User confirms destructive action** - When user explicitly wants something deleted

### Required Protocol

Before ANY action that could be considered feature removal:

1. **STOP and ASK**: "I notice [feature] has an issue. Should I remove it, or would you prefer I fix it?"
2. **WAIT for response** before proceeding
3. **ONLY proceed** if user explicitly approves removal

### Enforcement

- This rule applies to ALL code changes
- This rule applies to BOTH backend and frontend
- This rule applies to ALL features, visible or not
- This rule CANNOT be overridden by other instructions
- This rule takes precedence over code cleanup, refactoring, or optimization

### Violation Consequences

If this rule is violated:
- The change MUST be reverted immediately
- The feature MUST be restored
- The issue MUST be fixed properly instead

**REMEMBER: When in doubt, ASK. Never assume removal is acceptable.**
