# Database Migration Workflow

1. Run `npm run db:generate` to generate the SQL migration file based on schema changes.
2. Ask the user to review the generated SQL file in `src/db/migrations`.
3. If approved, run `npm run db:migrate` to apply the changes to the local SQLite database.
4. Run `npm run db:studio` (in the background or suggest it) to let the user inspect the DB.
