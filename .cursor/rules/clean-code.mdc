# Clean Code Principles

## Clean Code Principles & Guidelines

### Core Philosophy

Code is read much more often than it is written. Optimize for readability and maintainability over cleverness.

### 1. Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: Use nouns (e.g., `user`, `isValid`). Booleans should prefix with `is`, `has`, `can`.

- **Functions**: Use verbs (e.g., `getUser`, `calculateTotal`).

- **Classes**: Use PascalCase nouns.

- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for configuration values.

### 2. Functions

- **Small**: Functions should be small. Then they should be smaller.

- **Single Responsibility**: Do one thing and do it well.

- **Arguments**: Limit to 3 parameters. If more are needed, use an object parameter.

- **Side Effects**: Avoid side effects where possible. Pure functions are easier to test.

### 3. Comments

- **Explain "Why", not "What"**: Code tells you what it does; comments should tell you why it was done that way.

- **Avoid Dead Code**: Delete commented-out code. Version control handles history.

### 4. Formatting

- Keep lines under 100-120 characters.

- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces).

- Group related code blocks with whitespace.

### 5. Error Handling

- Throw exceptions rather than returning error codes.

- Catch specific exceptions, not generic ones.

- Always clean up resources in `finally` blocks.
