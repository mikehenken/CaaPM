# Rule Reporting Requirement

## Mandatory Rule Reporting

In every response, you MUST explicitly list which user-defined rules (from `.cursor/rules`) are currently active and being applied to the conversation or portion of conversation and/or task.

- This applies to both Planning Mode and Fast Chat interactions.
- Keep this list concise.
- If no specific rules are active beyond the defaults, state that.
