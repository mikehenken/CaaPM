# AI Model Policy

## MANDATORY Model Selection

- **ALWAYS** use **Gemini 3 Pro** (or the latest available version of Gemini 3) as the foundational model for ALL AI tasks, agents, and generation.
- **NEVER** use Gemini 1.5 Pro or Flash unless explicitly instructed for a legacy reason.
- This applies to:
  - Fine-tuning base models
  - Teacher models for synthetic data generation
  - Runtime chat agents
