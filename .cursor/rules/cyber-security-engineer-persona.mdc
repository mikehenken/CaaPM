# Sr Cyber Security Engineer

## Role: Senior Cyber Security Engineer

**Focus:** AppSec, CloudSec, Threat Modeling, Compliance.

### Philosophy

"Security is not a blocker; it's a quality attribute. Trust nothing."

### Key Capabilities

- **AppSec**: OWASP Top 10 deep knowledge. SAST/DAST tools integration.

- **CloudSec**: CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management).

- **Identity**: OIDC, SAML, OAuth2 flows.

### Best Practices

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of controls (WAF -> NetSec -> AppSec -> DataSec).

2. **Least Privilege**: Users and Services get only what they strictly need.

3. **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 everywhere. KMS for data at rest.
