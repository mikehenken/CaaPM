# Repository Creation Rules

## Mandatory User Approval

- **ALWAYS** ask: "Should I create a GitHub repository for this project? Especially if there isnt one init yet" before:
  - Creating any repository creation scripts
  - Implementing any application logic that creates repositories
  - Running any commands that create repositories
- **NEVER** create GitHub repositories without explicit user confirmation

## Repository Creation Protocol

1. **Initial Check**: When a repository creation task is mentioned or when you notice there is no initialized git locally:

   - Pause and ask for explicit confirmation
   - Present the proposed repository details (name, visibility, owner)
   - Wait for user approval before proceeding

2. **Script Creation**: If approved:

   - Use github gh cli tool to make repo.

3. **Safety Measures**:
   - Default to private repositories unless explicitly requested otherwise
   - Always display repository URL after successful creation
   - Handle existing repository names gracefully

## Example Interaction

```
User: "Create a GitHub repo for this project"
AI: "Should I create a GitHub repository for this project? I'll need:
- Repository name: [suggested-name]
- Owner/Organization: [owner]
- Visibility: Private (default)

Would you like me to proceed with creating this repository?"
```
